        <h1>The Calorie Tracker Story</h1>
            <p>The Calorie Tracker Application is developed for individuals who strive
                to maintain healthy diets and keep a consistent watch on their daily calorie intake.
                As developers, we have designed a program to allow users to input each meal and track their
                daily calorie intake and then compare it to results found by formulas that show factors such as
                body mass index and metabolic rates connected to the user. This allows our users to set goals and have a
                reliable source to help maintain them. Our goal at Calorie Tracker is to ensure our users have a reliable, functional platform that gives them an opportunity to
                live healthy lives. We understand the need for healthy diets in people of all ages, so we have designed an interphase simple enough for
                any type of user. We will continue to enhance the application and accompany any user wants through updates in the future.</p>

        <p2> Thank you so much for choosing Calorie Tracker for your everyday health needs. Please scroll down to meet the team behind the application
                foundation and development!</p2>
